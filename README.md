# my_DSA
this is a repository which contains my implementations of DSA in C++ mostly in OOP style

* list.cpp - linked list (traverse, insertion, deletion, reversing)
* doubleList.cpp - doubly linked list (traverse, insertion, deletion)
* stack.cpp - stack structure using arrays (push, pop, traverse)
* stackLinked.cpp - stack structure using linked lists (push, pop, traverse)
* balancedParan.cpp - famous balanced paranthesis question using stack structure
* xfix.cc - algorithms to evaluate Infix, Prefix and postfix notation including infix to postfix
* queue.cpp - queue structure using circular array (enqueue, dequeue, traverse)
* queueList.cc - queue structure using linkedlist (enqueue, dequeue, traverse)
* stack_using_queue.cpp - implementing a logical stack using two queues
* queue_using_stack.cpp - implementing a logical queue using two stacks
* fib_fac.cc - various methods to implement nth fibonacci and nth factorial number
* graphs.cc - graph structure using adjacancy list method (standard STL List is used) (depth and breath first traversal)
* sorting.cpp - implementation of selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort
* trees.cpp - binary tree specifically Binary Search Tree structure (designing a BST, inserting to BST, deleting from BST, binary tree traversal methods like level order, pre order, in order and post order, find an element, the minimum, maximum, height in BST, check if a binary tree is BST)
* binarySearch.cc - Binary Search in a sorted array
