# my_DSA
this is a repository which contains my implementations of DSA in C++ mostly in OOP style

* list.cpp - linked list (traverse, insertion, deletion, reversing)
* doubleList.cpp - doubly linked list (traverse, insertion, deletion)
* stack.cpp - stack structure using arrays (push, pop, traverse)
* stackLinked.cpp - stack structure using linked lists (push, pop, traverse)
* balancedParan.cpp - famous balanced paranthesis question using stack structure
* xfix.cc - algorithms to evaluate Infix, Prefix and postfix notation including infix to postfix
* queue.cpp - queue structure using circular array (enqueue, dequeue, traverse)
* queueList.cc - queue structure using linkedlist (enqueue, dequeue, traverse)
* fib_fac.cc - various methods to implement nth fibonacci and nth factorial number
* graphs.cc - graph structure using adjacancy list method (standard STL List is used) (depth and breath first traversal)
* sorting.cpp - implementation of selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort
